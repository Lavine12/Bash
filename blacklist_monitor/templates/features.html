<h1>Application Features</h1>
<p>This page provides an overview of what the blacklist monitor can do.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add or remove single IPs or CIDR ranges.</li>
    <li>Add or remove DNSBL domains (bulk import supported).</li>
    <li>Create groups and assign IPs using checkboxes. When a group is deleted the IP addresses are not removedâ€”they are placed back in the ungrouped list so you can reassign them later.</li>
    <li>Manual blacklist check for a single IP.</li>
    <li>Adjustable check schedule via the web UI.</li>
    <li>Periodic checks run according to the configured schedule.</li>
    <li>Alerts are sent to a Telegram chat when an IP is blacklisted.</li>
    <li>Dashboard shows last and next check times along with blacklist results.</li>
    <li>Backup past check results with searchable history and configurable schedule. Old backups are cleaned up automatically based on your retention settings for days or total count.</li>
    <li>View streaming application logs with a configurable history size (default 200 entries).</li>
</ul>
